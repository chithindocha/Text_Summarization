CNN was part of a group taken to the Sohae Satellite Launching Station in Tongchang-ri, in the northwest part of the country. North Korea announced last month that it would launch a rocket carrying a satellite between April 12 and 16 to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, the founder of the Communist state. His birthday on April 15, known as the \"Day of the Sun,\" is a key public holiday in the North Korean calendar. Pyongyang says the operation is for peaceful purposes, but Japan, the United States and South Korea see the launch as a cover for a long-range ballistic missile test. Firing the long-range rocket would breach U.N. Security Council resolutions, and Washington has suspended a recent deal to provide food aid to North Korea as a result. Japan has said it will shoot down any part of the rocket that enters its territory. \"If you look for yourselves with your own eyes, then you can judge whether it\\'s a ballistic missile, or whether it\\'s a launch vehicle to put a satellite into orbit,\" Jang Myong Jin, head of the launch site, said through a translator. \"That\\'s why we\\'ve invited you to this launch site.\" Journalists -- who were not allowed to take laptops or cell phones to the site, but were permitted to film -- were shown the control center and the satellite that officials said would be shot into space. The rocket itself is 30 meters, or about 100 feet, long. It was white, with some red and blue paint. International leaders have urged North Korea to cancel the launch, but Pyongyang has refused to back down, insisting that the operation is for scientific purposes. The last time Pyongyang carried out what it described as a satellite launch, in April 2009, the U.N. Security Council condemned the action and demanded that it not be repeated. An independent European analyst who visited the launch site said he saw nothing obvious that raised red flags. \"I don\\'t know what they want to do in the future, but today what we see is a space launcher,\" said Christian Lardier.'"]},"execution_count":4,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["df['source_text'][20001]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-24T11:20:56.187952Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-24T11:20:56.187441Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-24T11:20:56.198859Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-24T11:20:56.197835Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-24T11:20:56.187920Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["\"summarize: A new Scotland: the debate will exercise the hearts and minds of voters in that country until next month's referendum. It was also a question faced by a generation of Scots 250 years ago. But they had to sail across the Atlantic to find their Nova Scotia. Disappearing act: Sian Lloyd raises a glass to the joys and freedom of travel in Nova Scotia . As the independence arguments raged - and as my husband and I yearned for traffic-free roads, trees and foodie treats - we booked a last-minute Icelandair flight to Halifax, Nova Scotia's capital, and for a week toured parts of this isolated eastern peninsula of Canada. Over two-thirds of the province is covered by forest - conifers, of course, but maple, birch, oak and mountain ash too. Nova Scotia is also the world's largest exporter of blueberries and Christmas trees. Celtic music is very much alive here and is one of the highlights of a visit; another is the freshly cooked lobster; yet another the whalewatching. In short, there's a lot on offer. There's certainly a lot of genealogy to discover. Within five minutes of our arrival, the jolly doorman at The Lord Nelson Hotel in Halifax proudly told us that he was a quarter French and a quarter Scottish. He waxed lyrical about how thousands of Highlanders came over and mixed in with French, English and Germans to form the unique strain of folk known as Nova Scotians. A haven in the New World: Nova Scotia's capital Halifax boasts a lovely waterside setting . The major Scottish influx to Nova Scotia began in 1773, when the Hector sailed into Pictou - acknowledged as the birthplace of New Scotland. It's an easy drive there from Halifax. An impressive full-size replica of the Hector was built in the town and is now in the harbour. Many of the guides are descendants of families that came over on the Hector. But it's hard to believe such a small vessel made it across the Atlantic. A walkabout below deck gets you wondering at the bravery and tenacity of those 200 early settlers. You can almost hear the melancholic notes of the pipes as you emerge blinking into the sunlight. From Pictou we took a two-hour scenic drive to the luxurious golf-focused resort of Fox Harb'r on the Northumberland Strait, passing small marshy tidal inlets and gentle rolling farmland on the way. You don't have to be obsessed with golf to stay here, but the gorgeous coastal panorama and the manicured course are enough to make you really want to learn. We chose to cycle and swim in the impressive 25-metre pool. Splendid sights: Sian encountered the Uisge Ban waterfalls (left), and the Red Shoe Pub in Inverness (right) We also went on wonderful walks on the beachfront and in the forests of the Cobequid Mountains, discovered the lovely local Jost wines, and slept like babies on down pillows in gigantic beds. Unsurprisingly for a province called New Scotland, there are a fair few top golf courses. We drove for half a day to get to Inverness in western Cape Breton, in order to stay at the beautifully chic glass-fronted Cabot Links golf course, and to tap our feet to Celtic reels at the famous Red Shoe Pub. Cabot Links hugs the shore, and is recognised as one of the world's greatest golf courses. The splendour of the place is truly appreciated from the Panorama restaurant. We witnessed two sublime sunsets and enjoyed two lots of lobster-stuffed ravioli and blueberry cobblers. Scenic, serene and scrumptious. We were very keen to cycle part of the Celtic Shores Trail. This 60-mile well-kept coastal track stretches from Post Hastings to Inverness, and has been on my bucket list for some time. It is accessed just down the road from Cabot Links, and is a pure pleasure to cycle. We went as far as Mabou and back, breaking the journey with a late lunch at the Red Shoe, which is owned by the folk-singing Rankin sisters. Both food and musicianship are second to none. Doughty: The harbour at Pictou has a replica of the Hector, which brought Scottish immigrants to Nova Scotia . We tucked in to crab dips with flatbreads and mussels and sweet potato chips, enjoying the heady combination of food, fun and fiddling, and staying far longer than we expected. We enjoyed sunny gin-clear skies while on Cape Breton, so saved the indoor attractions till last, just in case the weather misbehaved. It didn't, so we rather rushed around must-visit attractions like the Alexander Graham Bell Museum and the Gaelic College, where we helped weave a kilt. Both places were entertaining and enjoyable and left us wondering whether we should have spent quite so much time at the splendid Uisge Ban Falls; or chatting with lobster fishers at Baddeck's lovely village market; or loitering over breakfast with owner Earlene Busch at the Chanterelle Inn. This place is a Cape Breton gem, intimate and tranquil, and serving local products, such as fiddlehead fern soup and local cranberries and blueberries. The menu changes nightly and names all the food sources. Our line-caught halibut was from Neil's Harbour, about 50 miles away. The bread at breakfast was fresh from the oven. Even the oatcakes were home-made. We left with a generous pile and munched away merrily on our journey to Sherbrooke on the Eastern Shore. As we know her best: Until recently, Sian had worked for ITV since 1990 . Sherbrooke village is a charming living museum. It's an actual village, though, superbly restored to its 19th century appearance and staffed by people in costume, portraying the experiences of the time. I rode a penny-farthing, got a recipe card from the printing press, watched wild rose hand-cream being made at the pharmacy, visited the telephone exchange, ate fresh-baked biscuits in the jailer's kitchen and spun some wool at the weaver's home. Disneyland, eat your heart out. This is the real deal, and that's the thing about Nova Scotia: it is warm, accessible and authentic. Scratch almost anyone and you'll find a Scot or two in the family tree, a kilt or a fiddle in the closet. It's as if a chunk of auld Scotland has been broken off by ancient giants and hurled on to Canada's north-east coast. The land and soil look the same, the weather's the same and you find the same hardy people. In some ways, it is more traditionally Scottish than Scotland. If Alex Salmond loses the referendum, to ease his sorrows I'd thoroughly recommend a trip to Cape Breton, a dance along the Ceilidh TrailÃ¢\\x80Â¦ and plenty of the island's own single-malt whiskies.

Respected Madam,It is an undeniable fact that parents are the major stakeholders in the functioning of the school. I would like to bring to your attention that the Parents Teacher Association, in schools, plays a potential role in bringing parents and teacher together and to understand each other and cooperate in the task of development of young impressionable minds. The two agencies must make a concerted effort in evolving a conducive atmosphere in school for children to attain their optimum potential. We would like to bring to your notice that on 12th Aprilâ€™2010, D.O.E had issued Guidelines for Constitution of Parents Teachers Association (P.T.A) in Aided / Unaided Schools. Whether any School recognizes or not, Parents are major stakeholders in the functioning of a School. However, Parents of Delhi Public School, Dwarka understand that there were no elections held for section of P.T.A representatives. Our concerns about the existing PTA stem from several factors, including a lack of transparency in decision-making processes, limited parent involvement, and an inadequate representation of diverse perspectives. These issues have resulted in a perceived disconnect between the PTA and the Parents and Teachers, hindering effective collaboration and mutual understanding.\n","Moreover, it has been noticed that the Parent Rep of a particular class is promoted as the parent rep of the subsequent class in the next academic session without any consent, elections, or intimation to rest of the parents. The current practice of PTA had jeopardized the entire purpose for which it was constituted, most of the parents are not even aware who is the PTA of their wardâ€™s class. There is no interaction between parents and PTA taking place which can strengthen the healthy communication amongst teachers and parents for overall development of ward and the school in totality.By initiating a fresh election of PTA members, we aim to provide an opportunity for all interested parents and teachers to actively participate in shaping the future of our school community. This process will enable the elections of PTA representatives who can foster open communication, encourage greater parental involvement, and work collaboratively with the school administration to address the evolving needs and concerns of students, parents, and teachers alike.We are also not sure if the any of the staff member of school are chosen as Parents Rep, if this is the case, it will lose the objective of basic purpose of constituting the Parents Teachers Association The staff members are bound to their Service Rules and have many constraints so many not project Parents point objectively in free and fair manner.Therefore, considering the above, we would like to request you to:\n","i.Dissolve the current unelected PTA with immediate effect. ii.Notify for conducting fresh and new fair and transparent P.T.A elections immediately in the current session before the given deadline. iii.School should notify the elections, personally informing all parents of the date and time through hard copy circulars with acknowledgment receipts for office use and SMS etc. iv.Eligible parents are to be encouraged to file the nominations and should be given enough time to file the nomination.v.One parent representative should not be allowed to continue for two consecutive terms. Since at present, there is a practice to continue the same person as a Parent representative for many years, which has seriously demeaned the main purpose of PTA to work in close coordination with teachers for the overall development of children.vi.One child One vote principle should be adopted. Only one vote for one parent may be verified with the Admission no. of the child.vii.Results may be published online without highlighting the names of parents who participated in elections. So that transparency be ensured.viii.The entire election process should be overlooked by a presiding officer, who can be a nominee from the DOE or any independent government official. ix.The complete elections process must be 100% transparent and elections, counting and declaration of results etc. should be held under the surveillance of a Video Camera. To ensure transparency and fairness, we recommend the formation of an independent election committee comprising both parents and teachers who are not currently associated with the PTA. This committee can oversee the election process, including the nomination of candidates, the dissemination of information, and the conduct of the actual voting.Requesting you to release the notification for free and fair election with immediate effect to ensure the principle of PTA body is exercised in true letter and spirit.\"\"\"\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import torch\n","model1 = torch.load('model.pth', map_location=torch.device(\"cuda\"))\n","model1.device= torch.device(\"cuda\")\n","\n","text_to_summarize = \"\"\"summarize: \"\"\" + text_input\n","predicted_output = model1.predict(text_to_summarize)\n","predicted_output"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-24T12:03:44.429385Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-24T12:03:44.428998Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-24T12:03:44.439163Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-24T12:03:44.438159Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-24T12:03:44.429356Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["text_summaries = []  # reference summary\n","for x in range(20001, 20101):\n","    summary = str(df['target_text'][x])\n","    summary = summary.replace(\"\\n\", \"\")\n","    print(summary)\n","    print(\"\\n\")\n","    text_summaries.append(summary)\n","text_summaries\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-24T12:04:21.650653Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-24T12:04:21.650251Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-24T12:04:21.656961Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-24T12:04:21.655944Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-24T12:04:21.650622Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["text_summaries[0]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-24T12:04:27.433296Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-24T12:04:27.432911Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-24T12:28:50.985862Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-24T12:28:50.984712Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-24T12:04:27.433268Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["model_summaries = []\n","for x in range(20001, 20101):\n","    model_summary = model1.predict(df['source_text'][x])\n","    \n","    model_summaries.append(model_summary)\n","    #print(model_summaries[x])\n","model_summaries"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-24T12:29:06.187512Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-24T12:29:06.187152Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-24T12:29:06.195111Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-24T12:29:06.193780Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-24T12:29:06.187480Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["model_summaries[0] #predicted "]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-24T12:29:06.198080Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-24T12:29:06.197222Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-24T12:29:06.208816Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-24T12:29:06.207754Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-24T12:29:06.198019Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["text_summaries[0] #reference"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-24T12:29:06.211141Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-24T12:29:06.210698Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-24T12:29:06.521312Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-24T12:29:06.520191Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-24T12:29:06.211109Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["from rouge import Rouge\n","\n","model_summaries = [str(summary) for summary in model_summaries]\n","text_summaries = [str(summary) for summary in text_summaries]\n","\n","rouge = Rouge()\n","rouge.get_scores(model_summaries, text_summaries, avg=True, ignore_empty=True)\n"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.16"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
